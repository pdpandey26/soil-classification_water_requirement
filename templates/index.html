                            <h2>BANANA TREE</h2>
                            <img class="let" src="https://c1.wallpaperflare.com/preview/26/955/618/nature-fruit-plants-leaves.jpg">
                            <p>Choosing the right planting site is key to making banana tree care easy. Grow this plant in a location where it will be sheltered from strong winds, as it is very susceptible to damaged leaves. Prepare your planting site by mixing some compost into the soil. And make sure you have enough space for the height and spread of your particular species</p>
                            <p>During the growing season (spring to fall), banana trees are water hogs. You might have to water daily, especially during hot weather, to maintain adequate soil moisture. The plants also will need regular fertilization throughout the growing season. Bananas form in the late summer in a cluster called a hand. Once the fruit is green but plumped up, it can be cut off the stalk and placed in a cool, dry space to finish ripening.</p>
                            <h3>Light</h3>
                            <p>Most types of bananas plants prefer to grow in full sun, meaning at least six hours of direct sunlight on most days. However, some varieties can scorch easily and will do better in partial shade.</p>
                            <h3>Soil</h3>
                            <p>These plants love organically rich, deep soil with good drainage and a slightly acidic soil pH. They typically have poor tolerance for salt in the soil.</p>
                            <h3>Water</h3>
                            <p>Banana trees are tropical and originate in rainforests, so they need a lot of water and plenty of moisture in the air. They do best when planted in groups fairly close together, as this helps to retain moisture in the leaves. Water regularly to make sure the soil stays evenly moist but not soggy. Avoid overwatering, which can cause root rot.</p>

                            <h2>SUGARCANE</h2>
                            <img class="let" src="https://cdn.wallpapersafari.com/29/23/uATeh2.jpg">
                            <p>Sugar cane is Widely cultivated on a mass scale commercially, the long, thick stems are harvested for their sweet sap, which is most commonly used to make sugar and molasses. The wax produced by the stem is used to make paper, insulation for electrics, and in furniture production. Sugar cane is also used in fuel production and as an energy-producing biomass.</p>
                            <p>This plant is also a major resource for indigenous people, and they drink the sap and use the leaf ash medicinally. It is used to treat, amongst other things, snake bites, sore throats, wounds, and eye discomfort.</p>
                            <p>The plants that are grown commercially don't offer much ornamental interest, but there are a wide variety of cultivars that are now grown in garden landscapes.
                             Given sugar canes love of hot temperatures, they are typically grown as annuals, but they can be overwintered indoors. Just bear in mind they typically reach two or three meters (and sometimes more) in height.
                            </p>
                            <p>The foliage colors vary depending on the cultivar you select, but they tend to be large and richly green with sharp edges - so sharp that care has to be taken when handling.
                            They typically produce flower spikes in the fall, although these will only bloom on plants being grown as perennials rather than annuals.</p>
                            <h3>Light</h3>
                            <p>Sugar cane does best in a full sun position. If you have a shady garden, this won't be the plant for you.</p>
                            <h3>Soil</h3>
                            <p>This plant can do well in most soil types, proving they are well-drained. It prefers it to be deep and friable (crumbly) too.
                            Sugar cane is known for being an energy-hungry plant. It saps the nutrients from soil rapidly. So a soil rich in organic matter is going to be important. Many enthusiasts mix a fertile compost and lime into the soil.</p>
                            <h3>Water</h3>
                            <p>Sugar cane likes to be kept consistently moist. If you don't live in a region that gets a lot of rainfall, it will need a decent amount of additional irrigation.
                            The only time that watering should be tailed off is if you plan to harvest mature stems. At this point, a dry spell will be beneficial for slowing growth and increasing the sugar production in the lower part of the stalks.</p>

                            <h2>POTATO</h2>
                            <img class="let" src="https://cdn.harvesttotable.com/htt/2009/01/23181312/canstockphoto18445615-1024x768.jpg">
                            <p>Potato (Solanum tuberosum) is arguably one of the world's most important food plants and commercial crops, providing an enormous volume of nutrients and digestible carbohydrates in the tuberous roots. Over centuries, these annual root vegetables have held off famine and starvation in many regions of the world, and few vegetables are more versatile</p>
                            <p>Potatoes are a member of the nightshade (Solanum) family of plants, a group that contains a number of important food vegetables, including tomatoes, eggplant, and peppers. Like those plants, potatoes contain toxic alkaloid compounds in the leaves and other green parts. But the mature roots of potatoes are deliciously edible.</p>
                            <p>Potatoes are usually planted as a winter crop; planting time can be anywhere from September to February. Time to full maturity can range anywhere from 90 to 120 days, depending on the variety. Small early potatoes are usually ready to harvest about 55 days after planting.</p>
                            <h3>Light</h3>
                            <p>To bolster top growth, which will support the growth of the roots, plant potatoes in full sun. They can handle part shade, but it's the lush top growth that feeds the tubers underground. The more sun, the better—at least six hours per day. The tubers need to be protected from the sun if they grow near the surface or they will turn green. Hilling is done to prevent this, which is simply mounding soil up near the stem of the plant as it grows.</p>
                            <h3>Soil</h3>
                            <p>Grow your potatoes in soil with an acidic pH between 5.0 and 6.0. Potatoes grown in soils with a higher pH seem prone to scab, which produces rough spots on the potato. Potatoes don't like particularly rich soil. If you have a good amount of organic matter in the soil and the pH is neutral to acidic, the potatoes should be happy. The soil needs to be loose and well-draining. If you have soil that is heavy in clay, you will need to prepare it down to the depth where the potato tubers will grow.</p>
                            <h3>Water</h3>
                            <p>Potato plants rely on a steady water supply. Water them at least 1 inch a week. They are sensitive to drought conditions, especially when they flower, as that is the peak time for forming the potato tubers. Mulching around the plants can help retain moisture.</p>

                            <h2>CABBAGE</h2>
                            <img class="let" src="https://www.wallpaperu3.com/wp-content/mywallpapers/green-cabbage-wallpaper-680x425.jpeg">
                            <p>Cabbage is a vegetable grown for its densely packed heads. Some can be quite beautiful. They are classified by head shape, round and flat-head being the most commonly seen. There are cabbages with smooth leaves and pronounced veins and some with crinkled, or savoyed, leaves. You'll find cabbages in shades of white, green, and purple, and the flavor varies by variety. There are even ornamental cabbage varieties bred for their looks, not their flavor.</p>
                            <p>Cabbage plants are moderately fast growers and typically are ready to harvest about two months after the seedlings emerge or are transplanted in the garden. They are biennial plants that are typically grown as annuals. These are cool-weather plants that grow best in late-summer to fall in most climates. They can also be planted in spring.</p>
                            <h3>Light</h3>
                            <p>Cabbage plants can handle full sun to light shade. Since cabbage plants are not setting flowers or fruit, they do not need a full day of sun. Gardeners in warmer climates will want to provide some shade during hot months, so the plants do not dry out.</p>
                            <h3>Soil</h3>
                            <p>Cabbages need a well-drained soil that is rich in organic matter. To help prevent a common cabbage disease called club root that is most prevalent in acidic soil, keep the soil pH above 6.8</p>
                            <h3>Water</h3>
                            <p>The biggest maintenance issue when growing cabbages is keeping them watered. Watering is also the key to preventing the heads from splitting. You want the cabbage heads to fill out, but not so quickly they burst open.</p>

                            <h2>WHEAT</h2>
                            <img class="let" src="https://img2.goodfon.com/wallpaper/nbig/f/e0/kolosya-pshenica-zlaki-pole.jpg">
                            <p>Wheat indeed is the best cereal grain as it contains higher protein than maize and rice. Moreover it is believed to be the best staple foods in today’s world. It is also used in preparing various food items like bread, biscuit, cereal, cookies, cakes, pasta, noodles etc</p>
                            <h3>Soil</h3>
                            <p>The soil must be properly prepared before starting the wheat farming. For this you can plough the soil either with disc or mould board plough. Then arrange the soil by giving one deep plough, followed by 2 to 3 light ploughing and planking. Now add natural fertilizers to it. For commercial wheat farming, an average of 50 kg Nitrogen, 25 kg Phosphorus and 12 kg
                             Potash is sufficient in one acre of land. Add more organic contents while preparing the soil</p>
                            <h3>Weather requirements</h3>
                            <p>Wheat plants can be grown and planted in a wide range of agro-climatic conditions. The plants have high flexibility and hence can be grown in the tropical, 
                            sub-tropical zones and temperate zone. The most suitable climate for wheat farming is moist and cool weather.  The plants can easily survive in temperature between 3.5 °C and 35 °C, but the best temperature for wheat farming is between 21 °C and 26 °C.</p>

                            <h2>TOMATO</h2>
                            <img class="let" src="https://c1.wallpaperflare.com/preview/242/308/871/tomatoes-garden-vegetables-healthy.jpg">
                            <p>Choosing the right planting site is key to making banana tree care easy. Grow this plant in a location where it will be sheltered from strong winds, as it is very susceptible to damaged leaves. Prepare your planting site by mixing some compost into the soil. And make sure you have enough space for the height and spread of your particular species</p>
                            <p>During the growing season (spring to fall), banana trees are water hogs. You might have to water daily, especially during hot weather, to maintain adequate soil moisture. The plants also will need regular fertilization throughout the growing season. Bananas form in the late summer in a cluster called a hand. Once the fruit is green but plumped up, it can be cut off the stalk and placed in a cool, dry space to finish ripening.</p>
                            <h3>Light</h3>
                            <p>Most types of bananas plants prefer to grow in full sun, meaning at least six hours of direct sunlight on most days. However, some varieties can scorch easily and will do better in partial shade.</p>
                            <h3>Soil</h3>
                            <p>These plants love organically rich, deep soil with good drainage and a slightly acidic soil pH. They typically have poor tolerance for salt in the soil.</p>
                            <h3>Water</h3>
                            <p>Banana trees are tropical and originate in rainforests, so they need a lot of water and plenty of moisture in the air. They do best when planted in groups fairly close together, as this helps to retain moisture in the leaves. Water regularly to make sure the soil stays evenly moist but not soggy. Avoid overwatering, which can cause root rot.</p>
